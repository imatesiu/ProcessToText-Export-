This technique generates natural-looking texts from BPMN process models. It can work with process models of arbitrary structure, makes minimal assumptions on the grammar of the comprised element labels, and preserves control flow order in the text. Details about the technique can be found [here](http://www.henrikleopold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2012_CAiSE_GeneratingNLTextsFromPMs.pdf).

Principal features added:
* support input file BPMN20 .bpmn
* fix minor bug
